Today is the day. It's the 12th of August 2025, my big day. Even if it doesn't
feel like it: My flight is scheduled in 2:45h, but there's no trepidation to be
found.

Up until now everything went great. The train was very full, but on time, the airport is easy to navigate. I found everything that I needed (including my farewell commitee) and the security check went without any problems. I was just missing some overview of all the technical devices, that I'm carrying with me. :sweat_smile:

The planning is working great, and fingers are crossed it's gonna stay like this.
